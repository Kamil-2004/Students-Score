## About
------

This script takes a list of student scores as input, converts them to integers, and finds the highest score.

## Usage
-----

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/highest-score-finder.git`
2. Navigate to the repository: `cd highest-score-finder`
3. Run the script: `python highest_score_finder.py`
4. Enter the list of student scores when prompted, separated by spaces.

## Code Explanation
-----------------

The script uses a simple iterative approach to find the highest score. It initializes the highest score to the first score in the list, then iterates through the rest of the list, updating the highest score if it finds a higher one.
